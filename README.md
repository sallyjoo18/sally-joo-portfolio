# Repo for Portfolio

This directory is aimed at creating a portfolio website. The files directly in the `sally-joo-portfolio` file are for the main/home page and the 
about/intro page. For the content within the projects tab, the `projects` folder includes not only the qmd files and other files associated with
different project categories but also the `style.css` for the page theme.
