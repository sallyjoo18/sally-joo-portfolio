The content should be replayed consistently throughout opening hours. Sound should not overlap with the store’s music, focusing more on visual information.\n\n\nSocial Media: Create video content ideas for Animal Record’s official Instagram page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGraphic Design & Social Media Management\n\n\n\n\nThe focuses of this deliverable were sticker redesign and social media content schedule. Because stickers are a great way to spread awareness of a store or brand, we decided that sticker designs that appeal to younger crowds are a cost-efficient way of increasing store awareness. Aligned with this focus on cost-efficiency, we also aimed to create a content posting schedule for the official Instagram page in order to making posting less overwhelming and easy to manage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent Planning, Marketing Research & Competitor Analysis\n\n\n\n\nAssignment: Vendor opportunity research & competitor analysis\n\n\nEvent Planning & Logistics: Research potential events for vinyl selling/purchasing at Norris or look for other vendor opportunities.
